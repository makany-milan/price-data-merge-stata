/*
Create master files for all the art data available.


Author: Milan Makany
Version: v1.1 (14/04/2021)


1) Price Data [DONE]
	a) Artsy fairs since October 2020
	b) Artsy fairs before October 2020
	c) Artsy collections (many saves on different dates) (not fair data)
	d) Non-Artsy Data
		dA) ArtBasel:OVR
		dB) Artissima (many saves on different dates)
		dC) FIAC (many saves on different dates)
		dD) Frieze Masters and London (many saves on different dates)
		dE) Vienna Contemporary (many saves on different dates)
		dF) Sotheby's (many saves on different dates) (not fair data)
		dG) GalleryPlatformLA (many saves on different dates) (not fair data)
		dH) Frieze
		dI) Merge all non-artsy fair files
		
2) Fair Data
	Merge for fairID & fair location

3) Artist/Gender Data
	_a) WE CAN USE THE MASTER MERGED DATABASE!
	(
	a) Artsy JSON & Dataset
	b) ArtFacts JSON
	c) Auction dataset from Renée
	d) Blouin
	e) Decision Tree & Neural Network models for unmatched artists
	)
	
4) Reformat variables and correct issues with the data


IDEAS:
	- Some part artsy fairs have corrupt gallery and artist data. Re-run codes
		with improved JSON extractor method.
		
	- Create a FairID variable for easier filtering
		merge 1:1 fairName year -> unique image_ID and fair_ID match
		
	- Since there are fairs for which we have price data on multiple days, create
		a date saved variable. Use metadata from file / extract from filename.
		Extracting metadata might only be possible in python.
		!!! Look into it further !!!
	
	- Reformat csv files (DONE)
	
	- Create dummy variable for fairs for easier filtering (DONE: isFair)
	
	- Some duplicates exist intra-fair. (DONE)
		Drop duplicates when reading in data or at the end
		CODE:
			bys url fair: gen _dupe = cond(_N==1, 0, _n)
		see: "intra_fair_dupes.png" for list
